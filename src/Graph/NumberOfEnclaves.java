/*
*   You are given an n x m binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.
*   A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell
*   or walking off the boundary of the grid.
*   Find the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
*
*   Input:    { {0, 0, 0, 0},
                {1, 0, 1, 0},
                {0, 1, 1, 0},
                {0, 0, 0, 0} }
